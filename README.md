IT-appen
========

IT-appen is an application developed for the IT chapter/section of Uppsala university.

Disclaimer: Code quality is (in retrospect) pretty shitty, and documentation does not exist... I apologize very, very much in advance.

How to run
------

Make sure you have [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) installed on your system, and run `pod install` through the command line before opening `IT-appen.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
